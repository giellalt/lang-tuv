This is free and open source South SÃ¡mi morphology.

Morphology
----------
This is a Turkana morphology for proof-of-concept demo of ATR harmony
among other things


Analysis symbols
----------------
We've ignored analyses for this part of proof-of-concept


Morphophonology
---------------
The ATR harmony affects following set of vowels, the leftmost being the
initial (neutral) and others downward modified in clockwise order.

And following triggers to control the ATR dominant overrides and ATR
stuff
our examples are verbs, but this is prefixing language, so we'll start from
there.
