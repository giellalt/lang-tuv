# This regex removes tags we do not want in the ordinary $(GTLANG).fst
# That is, we do not give them as output from analysis

# This file is just a dummy file, to be replaced by real content, or
# perhaps, if you remember to adjust the makefile as well, deleted.

# delete dialect tags, if we had some:
0 <- %+Dial%/%-OneDialectOnlyForms,
0 <- %+Dial%/%-AnotherDialectOnlyForms;
